<h1>OCR and Object Detection in Flutter</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently, I attended a talk by Tess, a Flutter developer at Cyber Tre Labs, where she shared her experience of creating her first application using object detection and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) in Flutter. The project was developed for Lum trailers, a company that manufactures trailers for transporting dry goods. Tess's application aimed to replace an existing costly and error-prone hardware system with a more efficient and cost-effective mobile solution using Flutter.</p>

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>The project focused on developing a smartphone application to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of unloading trailers at customer sites. Tess detailed the process of implementing object detection to ensure that the trailer's hose was correctly connected to the silo pipe and using OCR to read the silo ID. This eliminated the need for expensive NFC tag readers and minimized human error. The solution utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) V8 for object detection, demonstrating how to acquire data, label it, train the model, and deploy it in a Flutter application.</p>

<h2>Implementation and Challenges</h2>
<p>Tess explained the technical steps involved in creating the application, including data acquisition, labeling, training the model with YOLO V8, and converting the model for use in Flutter. The Flutter Vision package was highlighted for its compatibility with YOLO V8, though it currently only supports Android. Despite some challenges, such as the need for better OCR performance for large single characters, the project successfully demonstrated the potential of using Flutter for complex computer vision tasks.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The project not only showcased the capabilities of Flutter in integrating advanced technologies like object detection and OCR but also highlighted practical solutions to real-world problems faced by companies like Lum trailers. Tess's presentation provided valuable insights and inspiration for developers looking to explore similar applications in Flutter.</p>
